            <p>Creating Contribution content from a Flare project - UI</p>
            <p>There are 3 types of content Flare users can send to a Contributor user: Review Packages, Contributor Documents, and Contribution Templates. This topic shows the UI for creating Contributor Documents and Contribution Templates.</p>

            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/file save to.png" class="FFTpopup" />
            </p>
            <p>In the Save As dialogue, select Flare Contribution File (*.mcco) or MadCap Document File (*.mcdoc). These file formats are effectively the same and interchangeable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That will open up the following wizard dialog:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/create contribution template1.png" class="FFTpopup" />
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/create contribution template3.png" class="FFTpopup" />
            </p>

            <p>Negative numbers</p>
            <p>Large number</p>
            <p>Text</p>
            <p>Various characters and symbols (Inc. international)</p>
            <p>The “default” active button should make sense</p>
            <p>Default options are displayed in the screenshot</p>
            <p>Cancel, Esc, Red ‘X’ and ALT+F4 close the dialog without change</p>
            <p>OK and Enter close dialog with changes</p>
            <p>Dialog is resizable and redraws correctly</p>
            <p>Dialog remembers setting and sizes from previous session</p>
            <p>Dialog opens correctly on a dual monitor system</p>
            <p>Clicking the icon in the upper left corner displays options:</p>
            <p>Restore, Move, Size, Min., Max., Close – All work</p>
            <p>Restore, Min., Max are disabled</p>
            <p>!File | Close or clicking “X” in tab closes the Editor and prompts to save changes if necessary</p>
            <p>Making any changes dirties the tab</p>
            <p>Saving changes removes “dirty” mark from the tab</p>
            <p>Editor can be floated and redocked</p>
            <p>All Editor functions work when Editor is floating</p>
